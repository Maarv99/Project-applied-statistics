# Video presentation

For the video presentation, you can speak over your slide deck.

**The video presentation must be no longer than 8 minutes.** 

It is fine if the video is shorter than 8 minutes, but it cannot exceed 8 minutes.

You may use any platform that works best for your group to record your presentation.
Below are a few resources on recording videos:

-   [Recording presentations in Zoom](https://kb.siue.edu/61721)
-   [Apple Quicktime for screen recording](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac)
-   [Windows 10 built-in screen recording functionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfPbr1mRDuo)
-   [Kap for screen recording](https://getkap.co/)

Once your video is ready, upload the video to Moodle, then embed the video in an new discussion post on the Moodle Forum.
