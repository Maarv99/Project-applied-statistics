# Presentation

In addition to the written report, your team will also create presentation slides (e.g. with [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/intl/en_en/slides/about/) with an adequate [template](https://slidesgo.com/themes)) and record a video presentation that summarize and showcase your project.

Introduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions.

These slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.

**For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document, and submit the PDF of the slides on Moodle.**

The slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide.

Here is a *suggested* outline as you think through the slides; you **do not** have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.

-   Title Slide
-   Slide 1: Introduce the topic and motivation
-   Slide 2: Introduce the data
-   Slide 3: Highlights from EDA
-   Slide 4: Final model
-   Slide 5: Interesting findings from the model
-   Slide 6: Conclusions + future work

### Video presentation

For the video presentation, you can speak over your slide deck.
**The video presentation must be no longer than 8 minutes.** It is fine if the video is shorter than 8 minutes, but it cannot exceed 8 minutes.
You may use any platform that works best for your group to record your presentation.
Below are a few resources on recording videos:

-   [Recording presentations in Zoom](https://kb.siue.edu/61721)
-   [Apple Quicktime for screen recording](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac)
-   [Windows 10 built-in screen recording functionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfPbr1mRDuo)
-   [Kap for screen recording](https://getkap.co/)

Once your video is ready, upload the video to Moodle, then embed the video in an new discussion post on the Moodle Forum.
